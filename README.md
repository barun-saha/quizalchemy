# QuizAlchemy: Transmute text into knowledge ðŸ’Ž

QuizAlchemy is a quiz generation application that leverages Google's [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) and Streamlit to create quizzes from any file or text. It allows users to input text or upload files, which are then transformed into a structured quiz format with multiple-choice questions of varying difficulty.


## Architecture
![QuizAlchemy Architecture](https://github.com/barun-saha/quizalchemy/blob/main/assets/quizalchemy_arch.png?raw=true)


## Features

QuizAlchemy can:
- Extract content from web URLs or uploaded files (PDF, DOCX, HTML)
- Generate a question bank using Google Gemini models via ADK
- Store questions in an SQLite database
- Create quizzes with a customizable mix of question difficulties (easy, medium, hard)

It uses three ADK agents:
- `DataIngestionAgent`: For extracting content from web pages or files.
- `QuizMasterAgent`: For generating quizzes based on the extracted content.
- `CoordinationAgent`: For coordinating the workflow and managing the question generation process.
